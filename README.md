# 🏃‍♂️ AtheleteQ

**Tagline:** Interactive front-end for athlete quizzes and performance visualization using webcam input (Vite + TypeScript).

---

## 🎯 Overview

**AtheleteQ** is a **web-based front-end application** that helps analyze and visualize athlete performance through interactive quizzes and webcam-based input.  
It’s built with **Vite + TypeScript** and uses a **mock API service** for simulating data flow. The app provides real-time performance dashboards and visual analytics using the **Victory** chart library.

Unlike traditional IoT-based systems, AtheleteQ uses only the **built-in webcam** for capturing activity — no external hardware or sensors are required.
